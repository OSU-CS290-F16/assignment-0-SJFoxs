<h2>Assignment 0</h2>

<p>Due Date: September 26 @4:59pm</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Permissions with files</li>
   <li>Linking correctly</li>
   <li>Setting up the directory</li>
</ul>

<p>I referenced a few sites in understanding what chmod changes in permission. <br> Trial and error was done in order to link everything and also setting up the directory.</p>

<h4>Learning</h4>

<ul>
   <li>Linking pages</li>
   <li>Publishing online</li>
</ul>

<p>For the most part I already knew about the basics and adding tags to alter the contents on a web page. <br> I used to be the webmaster for my highschool and was in charge of maintaining the site while updating the content.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>

<ul>
   <li>www.catcode.com/teachmod/index.html</li>
   <li>www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</li>
   <li>www.oregonstate.edu/helpdocs/accounts/onid-osu-network-id/using-your-onid/publishing-your-website</li>
   <li>Assignment 0 Guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>I mainly used these resources as a point of reference and attempted multiple approaches to setup the site in the way that I wanted.<br> Since we weren't working with CSS initially, I decided to let it go until we arrive at that point.</p>
