<h4>A little about myself</h4>
<p>The most unique experience I've had is going to Paris, France with my sister for an entire week during spring break.</br> We travelled to multiple tourist sites but the real fun was walking around the city without a guide and a limited amount</br> of knowledge of the language. We found ourselves in a supermarket, mall, subway system, and finally a palace.</p>
